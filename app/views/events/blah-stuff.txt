let me know when your done, i be the ex spek - the whole neck - protocol son - 

I be the product of none - every-time you see me on the streets - keep neat - on like the sun.

the reflection of my eyes not fun, kick it back one foot, i be all but none to put.

you laugh hard but none make fun of it. i see you turn hard but can't run from it.


open my door, bitch, what for - you know you can't find some of it. all words rhyme quite time far from it.

missing and eye, with a slight turn of my head had over an uplifting hi.
